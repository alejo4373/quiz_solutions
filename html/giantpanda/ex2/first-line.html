        <h1>ABOUT THE GIANT PANDA</h1>

        <p>
            The giant panda has an insatiable appetite for bamboo. 
            A typical animal eats half the day—a full 12 out of every 
            24 hours—and relieves itself dozens of times a day. 
            It takes 28 pounds of bamboo to satisfy a giant panda's
            daily dietary needs, and it hungrily plucks the stalks 
            with elongated wrist bones that function rather like thumbs. 
            Pandas will sometimes eat birds or rodents as well.

        <h2>Behavior and Habitat</h2>
        
        <p>
            Wild pandas live only in remote, mountainous regions in
            central China. These high bamboo forests are cool and 
            wet—just as pandas like it. They may climb as high as
            13,000 feet to feed on higher slopes in the summer season.
